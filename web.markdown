StoryClime teaches children about the science that underpins our world by making them the protagonists of their own adventures stories. The StoryClime app uses information inputted by you, the parent (first name, age, name of teddy), and data taken from a range of sources (such as NASA Mars Insight Weather Station, and the OpenWeatherApp), to create unique adventures for your child, narrated by their own imaginary friend. The StoryClime app is completely free for all Earthbound users.

For parents that want to really push the limits of their child's imagination, StoryClime provides a complete learning suite, spanning both online applications and real world interactive objects. These premium Moonbound members will receive the StarClimber1, a model space shuttle that will teach your child about their environment (temperature, pressure, and humidity) and the wonders of flight (pitch, yaw, and roll), through real time data displayed in the cockpit section of their StoryClime dashboard.
