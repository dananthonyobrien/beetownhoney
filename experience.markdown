***The Writer and the Work Seminar, 2019***

 In 2017, I took up the position of Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow at University College Dublin, where I taught across a range of literary modules. In feedback, students wrote: 
 * “There was a wonderful atmosphere in class, enhanced by Dan’s efforts to make every comfortable”
 * “It wasn’t just the standard tutorial, Dan actually got us engaged and talked about the course and the novels, really excellent tutor” 
 * “enthusiasm brought to class and the teaching in general”. 
 Subsequently, I was nominated for a Teaching and Learning Award by my students. 
 
 I received the inaugural Irish Research Council Maurice J. Bric Medal for Excellence in the Humanities, for his postdoctoral book application, which received the highest score in the country. I also successfully applied for UCD Seed Funding to organise “Infamous, Influential, Beloved”, an event that brought contemporary Irish Writers to UCD to explore the university’s literary archives and share their results with students.

In 2016, I travelled to Ecuador to teach English literature at Colegio Menor San Francisco de Quito, partner school to the Universidad San Francisco, the country’s leading university. In feedback, students said of my classes:
* “fun… but also challenging”
* “the feedback is very useful”
* “l love this class because you can feel how passionate Dan is about this subject. He makes the students like it as much as he does”. 

I also taught creative writing, from fiction, to poetry, to drama, to film. Classes often covered themes of technology and space, and at the end of term one of my students presented me with a stargazing portrait. (Above. Image Credit: Daniella Vasco).

In 2012 I began an Irish Research Council funded PhD in Literature at UCC, where I taught undergrad and postgrad classes. In feedback, students praised: 
* "Wide range of materials. Definite structure, with allowances for interesting class discussion"
* "the way the subject was introduced really guided the student"
* "genuinely enjoyed the whole seminar". 

During my time at UCC, a Murphy Irish Exchange Fellowship allowed me study at the University of Notre Dame for a year in 2015.  Bursaries from Emory University, the Irish Association of American Studies, and the Library of Congress, also aided my research and helped me to completed my PhD in 2016 on time and within budget.
